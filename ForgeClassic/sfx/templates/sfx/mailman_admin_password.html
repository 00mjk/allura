<div>
  <p>Each mailing list has one mailing list admin password. You will need to
  provide this password to any other team members who perform list
  administration. We recommend that at least two people on each project team be
  aware of the list admin password, as that they may both tend to pending
  administrative requests, if needed.

  Do not use your SourceForge.net user account password as the list admin
  password.
