    Your project currently has {{vhosts.__len__()}} VHOSTs out of a
    maximum 10 permitted for your project.

  <h2>Add New Virtual Host</h2>
  <p>

    Please follow the instructions in the documentation titled,
    "<a href="http://p.sf.net/sourceforge/vhost"
       >VHOST Services for SourceForge.net Projects</a>", located in the
    Site Documentation collection. This document covers the correct way to
    configure your DNS services to direct traffic to your VHOST at SourceForge.net.
  </p>
  <p>
    One VHOST should be added for each host and each domain, for which you
    wish for us to answer traffic. For example, separate VHOST would need to
    be added for yourhost.org and www.yourhost.org. Clicking on the "Create"
    button will schedule your VHOST for creation; this is not an immediate
    process (see the aforementioned documentation for further details).
  </p>
