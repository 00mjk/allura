Introducing the new *Forge Platform:*
======================================

Rather than build yet another forge, we decided to do something new.   We wanted to build a new kind of extensible forge, and a new set of highly integrated forge tools. 

Pyforge is an **open** platform for **open** software development tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's easy to get frustrated with existing development tools.   Too often they are overbearing, complex, and make assumptions that get in your way.  And even if they are open source, it's often difficult to get them to work the way you need them too. 

Which is why we created PyForge.   It's designed to be truely **open**, in many different senses of the word. 

It's open in that:
 
* It's a combination of tools available under *Free* or *Open Source* licenses. 
* It's designed around a plugin archetecture, and anybody willing to contribute a plugin can play.   
* It's being hosted publicly, and is build through contributions of individuals and companies who want to promote Open Source development.   
* It's designed to provide a structure around which welcoming (open) communities can grow. 
* It's core plugins are designed around inclusive development processes.

We looked at existing forges, but to achieve all those goals, we needed to build something new.

PyForge is designed to support an **ecosystem**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyForge is at once a **set of tools** to help people collaboratively develop software, and an **open platform** on which innovative new tools be built.
