<h1>Searching wiki</h1>
<p>Searches use wiki page title and inner text for matching.<p>
<p>You can also use 'Search comments?' and 'Search history?' checkboxes to include comments and history of pages editing in the search results.</p>

<p>If you want to see all the page with given label, you may use url like this (there is no UI for this):</p>
<div class="codehilite">
<pre>/p/yourproject/wiki/search/?q=labels_t:label&amp;parser=standard</pre>
</div>
